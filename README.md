# Module-1-challenge

## Description
This repository was created in order to practice "on job ticket" work. I will clone a premade repository and refactor it, and, ensure that no bugs are present. I will also review and edit the code in hopes to make it easier for future developers to modify and understand. The following is a link to a screenshot of the webpage: Screenshot_18-4-2024_03841_erickrenaud05.github.io.jpeg

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
This website was created with intention to practice adding accesibility feature to already created website. First open the chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Then you will be able to see code with proper semantics and accesibility features. Visit it at https://erickrenaud05.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/
