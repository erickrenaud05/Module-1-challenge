# Module-1-challenge

## Description
This repository was created in order to practice "on job ticket" work. I will clone a premade repository and add accessibility, and, ensure that no bugs are present. I will also review and edit the code in hopes to make it easier for future developers to modify and understand.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
This website was created with intention to practice adding accesibility feature to already created website. First open the chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Then you will be able to see code with proper semantics and accesibility features.
